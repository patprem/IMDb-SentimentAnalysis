<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### Background

For the area of analysis of movie review, sentiment analysis means finding the mood of the public about how they judge a specific movie. And based on the reviews available online, in this instance, IMDb, most movie buffs would love to view the ratings of a movie before they book their tickets, as this may influence their experience from the movie and whether it is worthwhile to spend their money and time. As such, this project aims to build a deep learning algorithm to classify the reviews in the IMDb movie reviews sentiment dataset.

**More information about the methodology and experiments conducted during the course of this project can be found at this [REPORT](https://github.com/patprem/SentimentAnalysis/blob/bcc06d4e5c01555570df185f26e0e45a25fc7366/Report.pdf)**
